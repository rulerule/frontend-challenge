## Developer Notes

- From my understanding the transcriptions is a component that can be used anywhere,
so decided to go that way and not give it a route, instead made an home route (still made the router
in a way that is easy to add new routes), but the transcription is just a component that can be imported
and not a view with its own route

## Shame Notes

- checkbox check sometimes looks centered... sometimes dont... my brain is having troubles dealing with it already, please lets pretend it is
